# Orion Eos ðŸŒ…

**Orion Eos** is the unified programming language at the heart of the [**Orion** ðŸŒŒ](https://github.com/JustinPhillipsPDX/Orion) operating system. Designed to seamlessly bridge system-level operations, middleware logic, and user interface components, **Orion Eos** provides a robust, modular, and backward-compatible foundation for building a modern, adaptive OS.

The inaugural implementation of **Orion Eos** is known as **Orion Genesis**, marking the first evolution of this language. As the language evolves, **Orion Eos** will serve as the core framework for all [**Orion**](https://github.com/JustinPhillipsPDX/Orion) components, enabling effortless updates and integrated AI-driven enhancements.

## Features

- **Unified Language Framework**: A single language covering the OS kernel, system services, and user applications.
- **Modular and Extensible**: Designed for scalability and future expansion without breaking existing functionality.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensures that updates propagate safely across all layers.
- **Performance-Optimized**: Tailored for efficient system-level operations while supporting high-level abstractions.
- **Foundation for Innovation**: Serves as the basis for advanced features such as AI-assisted system management and dynamic file organization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern C++ compiler (supporting C++17 or later)
- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- Git for version control

### Building Orion Eos

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/OrionEos.git
   cd OrionEos
   ```

2. **Configure the Build**:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

3. **Compile the Language**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. **Run Tests** (if available):
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

## Roadmap

- [x] Initial repository setup and documentation
- [ ] Core language parser and interpreter for **Orion Eos**
- [ ] Integration of **Orion Genesis** as the first production version
- [ ] Comprehensive standard library for system and application development
- [ ] AI-driven language enhancements and dynamic optimization modules
- [ ] Ongoing cross-layer integration with [**Orion**](https://github.com/JustinPhillipsPDX/Orion) OS
